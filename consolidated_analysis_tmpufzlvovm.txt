# CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY IMPACT REPORT
## Public Law 119-21 (H.R. 1) - Reconciliation Act

---

## 1. BILL SUMMARY:

Public Law 119-21, enacted July 4, 2025, is a comprehensive reconciliation act that fundamentally reshapes U.S. fiscal policy through massive tax cuts, defense spending increases, energy development expansion, and elimination of climate programs. The bill implements permanent tax relief including elimination of taxes on tips, overtime pay, and car loan interest; extends Trump-era individual tax cuts; provides full expensing for business property and R&D; and significantly expands oil, gas, and coal leasing on federal lands. It completely repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and eliminates most EPA climate programs while increasing defense spending across shipbuilding, munitions, and Indo-Pacific capabilities. The legislation also modifies SNAP work requirements, caps CFPB funding, authorizes spectrum auctions, and creates new family tax credits. Budget impact includes multi-billion dollar tax revenue reductions offset by environmental program rescissions estimated at $27+ billion and increased energy lease revenues.

## 4. MARKET PREDICTIONS:

### Mid-term (6-18 months):

**Energy sector outperformance of 25-40%** as companies rapidly expand drilling on newly available federal acreage and offshore blocks; immediate cash flow benefits from reduced compliance costs drive dividend increases and buybacks. **Defense contractors rally 15-25%** on multi-year contract visibility and appropriations certainty; shipbuilders see particular strength. **Financial services gain 12-20%** as CFPB constraints reduce legal reserves and compliance staffing needs; auto loan origination volumes surge 30-40% from interest deductibility. **Manufacturing sector advances 10-18%** as capital equipment orders accelerate from full expensing provisions; order backlogs build through 2026. **Renewable energy sector declines 35-50%** as project financing evaporates and residential solar installations drop 40-60%; sector consolidation begins with weaker players facing bankruptcy. **Broader market volatility** from deficit concerns as tax cuts exceed spending reductions; Treasury yields rise 50-75 basis points pressuring valuations. **Small-cap outperformance** of 8-12% versus large-caps as domestic-focused businesses benefit disproportionately from tax provisions.

### Long-term (2-5 years):

**Energy sector sustains premium valuations** with 2027-2030 production growth of 15-25% from current levels; U.S. becomes dominant global LNG exporter; however, oil price suppression from oversupply limits gains to 40-60% cumulative by 2030. **Defense spending plateau risk emerges post-2027** as fiscal pressures mount; sector returns moderate to 8-12% annually after initial surge. **Financial services sector consolidation accelerates** with 15-20 major M&A transactions by 2028 as regulatory relief enables geographic expansion; sector compounds at 10-14% annually. **Manufacturing renaissance delivers sustained growth** of 12-15% annually through 2028 as reshoring accelerates and capital stock modernizes; automation and AI integration enhance productivity. **Renewable energy sector bottoms 2026-2027** then recovers 60-80% of losses by 2030 as state-level policies and corporate sustainability commitments provide alternative support; sector composition shifts toward utility-scale versus residential. **Deficit concerns trigger fiscal crisis risk 2027-2029** as debt service costs exceed $1.5 trillion annually; potential tax increase legislation or spending cuts create policy uncertainty. **Inflation resurges to 4-5%** by 2027 from energy-driven economic acceleration and deficit spending; Federal Reserve maintains elevated rates pressuring growth stocks. **Value factor outperforms growth by 30-40% cumulatively** through 2029 as interest rates remain elevated and traditional industries benefit from policy tailwinds.
