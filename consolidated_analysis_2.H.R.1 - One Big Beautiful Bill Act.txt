## 4. MARKET PREDICTIONS

### Mid-term (6-18 months)

**Defense sector** experiences immediate 15-25% stock appreciation as $122B appropriations translate to contract awards Q2-Q4 2025. Prime contractors (LMT, HII, GD, NOC, RTX) see order backlogs extend 3-5 years. Supply chain constraints emerge by Q4 2025 as munitions production ramps, benefiting specialty manufacturers (KTOS, AJRD, TDY). Expect defense sector to outperform S&P 500 by 800-1200 basis points through 2026.

**Energy sector** rallies 20-30% as Gulf lease sales commence Q3 2025 and ANWR permitting accelerates. Oil service companies (SLB, HAL, NOV) see 25-40% gains on drilling activity surge. Clean energy stocks (ENPH, SEDG, FSLR) decline 30-50% as tax credit terminations (2025-2027) eliminate project economics. Expect energy sector rotation from renewables to traditional hydrocarbons, with XLE outperforming ICLN by 3000+ basis points.

**Financial services** experiences bifurcated impact: Money center banks (JPM, BAC, WFC) gain 10-15% on auto loan origination growth and wealth management fee expansion.

**Broader market implications**: S&P 500 faces 3-5% correction Q2 2025 as clean energy weight (4% of index) reprices downward, offset by defense/energy gains. Russell 2000 outperforms (+8-12%) on domestic manufacturing bias (100% bonus depreciation, R&D expensing). High-tax state real estate (NY, CA, NJ, CT) appreciates 5-8% on SALT cap increase driving housing demand. Treasury yields rise 40-60 basis points on $300B+ deficit impact, pressuring rate-sensitive sectors (utilities, REITs).

### Long-term (2-5 years)

**Defense industrial base** undergoes structural transformation as $122B+ appropriations drive capacity expansion 2026-2029.
